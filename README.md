## Introduction

Similarly  to the [copy_to_cpu](../copy_to_cpu) example in this example we show
how to use the bmv2 digest extern to send information to the control plane
using an out of band channel. In the digest we send a tuple with: `(random_number, src_ip, dst_ip)`.

## How to run

Run the topology:

```
sudo p4run
```

Run the very small controller code that receives packets from the switch:

```
sudo python get_digest.py
```

Any packet will trigger a digest so we can simply run a ping between h1 and h2, from the CLI

```
mininet> h1 ping h2 -c1
```
